Some students would choose to sell items in WeChat Group but people in Group may easily miss because of mass information. This website is aimed at helping students sell easily. Students can upload their items on the website and delete after transactions. For convenience, students can upload several items once and get a long picture of all items, which can be used in WeChat Group. Also, other users can search what they want on the website.
